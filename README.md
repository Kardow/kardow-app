# A Supabase Kanban board using React

I was looking for a kanban board using supabase, and I was not able to find one. The only example available was built using Svelte, but I was looking for an alternative with React. As I was not able to find one, I decided to build it myself. This project is using supabase for the backend and React for the front-end. I used the newly Supabase UI library to get a similar look as Supabase, but I also added MUI and Mantine as Supabase UI is not enough advanced yet for more complex UI components.

Tech Stack :
- Supabase
- MUI
- Supabase UI (NEW)
- Mantine and @MantineUi
- react-beautiful-dnd

** This project is built using typescript **
